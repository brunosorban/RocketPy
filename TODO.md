| Integration with Fusion360 (or similar)   | Make RocketPy able to read a 3D geometry file that contains the entire Rocket description. This could save us a few minutes, as we would no longer need to measure multiple distances in our CAD software.                                                                                                                | Hard                  | Autodesk Fusion 360 API            | Not started                             |

| Multibody Dynamics Parachute Flight Phase | Currently, descent under parachute is simulated as a 3 degree of freedom (DOF) system. However, parachutes can and should be modeled separately from the rocket, creating a 6 (DOF) system, 2 for the parachute (spherical constrain) and 3 for the rocket. This can greatly enhance the prediction of the landing point. | Hard                  | Dynamics                           | Not started                             |
